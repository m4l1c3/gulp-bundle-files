#Contributing

In cases where bugs or issues arise please feel free to file an issue (I'll gladly look into them as time permits), or
submit a pull request.  In the case that you are providing a fix, please make sure to have test coverage for whatever
changes are being introduced, coverage is required to merge anything into the master branch.

Thanks and good luck!
